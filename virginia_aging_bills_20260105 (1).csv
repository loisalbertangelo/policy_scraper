The bill makes various changes to procedures under which the Commission reviews the earnings and sets the rates of investor-owned incumbent electric utilities. The bill provides that, in lieu of the triennial review proceedings required under current law, Dominion Energy Virginia, beginning in 2023, will be subject to biennial reviews of their rates, terms, and conditions for generation, distribution, and transmission services. The bill requires that if, during a biennial review filed on or before December 31, 2023, the Commission determines that the utility has earned more than 70 basis points above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills. For a biennial review filed after December 31, 2023, the bill requires that if the Commission determines that the utility has earned above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills and that all of any such overearnings that were more than 150 basis points above the utility's fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services be credited to customers' bills. The bill requires that the Commission, in determining a fair rate of return on common equity for an investor-owned electric utility in any biennial review initiated prior to December 31, 2023, set such rate at 9.70 percent, which is based on the simple average of the authorized returns for vertically integrated electric utilities by the applicable regulatory commissions in the peer group jurisdictions of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. The bill provides that for any review after December 31, 2023, the Commission may use any methodology to determine such return it finds consistent with the public interest. The bill provides that the Commission may increase or decrease an electric utility's combined rate of return for generation and distribution services by up to 50 basis points based on factors that may include reliability, generating plant performance, customer service, operating efficiency of a utility, and load forecasting. The bill requires the Commission, before December 31, 2023, to direct the initiation of a proceeding to review and determine the appropriate protocols and standards applicable to implementing any such performance-based adjustments. The bill provides that in any proceeding to establish base rates for Appalachian Electric Power or Dominion Energy Virginia conducted by the Commission, if the Commission determines in its sole discretion that the utility's existing base rates will, on a going-forward basis, either produce (1) revenues in excess of the utility's authorized rate of return or (2) revenues below the utility's authorized rate of return, then the Commission is required to order any reductions or increases, as applicable and necessary, to such base rates that it deems appropriate to ensure the resulting base rates (A) are just and reasonable and (B) provide the utility an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services over the rate period and earn a fair rate of return. The bill requires Dominion Energy Virginia, in its 2023 biennial review, to combine certain rate adjustment clauses having a combined annual revenue requirement of at least $350 million with the utility's base rates. The bill provides that the combination of such rate adjustment clauses is subject to audit by the Commission in the utility's 2023 biennial review filing. The bill authorizes the Commission to, in its discretion, direct the consolidation of any previously implemented rate adjustment clauses in the interest of judicial economy, customer transparency, or other factors the Commission determines to be appropriate. The bill requires the Commission to include in its report to the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation and the Governor any information concerning the reliability impacts of generation unit additions and retirement determinations by Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy Virginia, along with the potential impact on the purchase of power from generation assets outside the Virginia jurisdiction used to serve the utility's native load.

For a biennial review filed after December 31, 2023, the bill requires that if the Commission determines that the utility has earned above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills and that all of any such overearnings that were more than 150 basis points above the utility's fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services be credited to customers' bills.

The measure also requires that at least 80 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier in calendar years 2030 through 2034 be generated from clean energy resources. In calendar year 2035 and every calendar year thereafter, 100 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier is required to be generated from clean energy resources. The clean energy mandates apply to a public utility or other person that sells not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy to retail customers or generates not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy for use by the person. The Director of the Department of Energy (the Department) is authorized to bring actions for injunctions to enforce these requirements. The measure requires the Department to adopt a Climate Action Plan that addresses all aspects of climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, resiliency, and assistance in the transition from current energy sources to clean renewable energy.

The measure requires the Council to develop and make available to each state agency training modules designed to facilitate the promotion of environmental justice. The measure requires the Department to establish the Just Transition Fund (the Fund) to be used for state programs, grants and loans, job training and placement programs that support renewable and clean energy development and energy efficiency, and for funding the Transitioning Workers Program, which provides support for workers in the fossil fuel industry and affected communities and provides such workers with job training, relocation support, income and benefit support, and early retirement benefits.

Requires Dominion Energy Virginia (DEV) and American Electric Power (AEP) to achieve incremental net annual savings in accordance with a schedule that starts in 2021, when savings are required to be at least 0.35 percent of the average annual energy retail sales by that utility in the three preceding calendar years, and increases the level of required savings until 2027 and thereafter, when savings are required to be at least two percent of the utility's average annual energy retail sales in the three preceding calendar years. The measure requires the utilities to retain an independent, qualified third-party evaluator to determine the utility's incremental net annual savings and other benefits of the program. The measure requires the State Corporation Commission, for any year that a utility meets the annual energy efficiency standard, to allow for the additional recovery of a margin on its program's operating expenses through a rate adjustment clause that provides the utility with a margin equal to the general rate of return on common equity. The Commission is directed to award an additional 20 basis points for each 0.1 percent of annual savings in excess of the required amount of savings, with a cap on total performance incentive awards in any year of 10 percent of the utility's total energy efficiency spending in that year. The measure also (i) increases the portion of the approved costs of certain utility energy efficiency programs that are required to be allocated to programs designed to benefit low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals from five percent to 15 percent of the approved costs of such programs and adds veterans to be benefited from such programs; (ii) requires the energy efficiency stakeholder process established for the purpose of providing input and feedback on the development of electric utilities' energy efficiency programs to include the participation of certain Commission personnel who participate in approval and oversight of utility efficiency programs; (iii) directs the Commission to increase the utility's rates to recover for revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs if the revenue reductions have caused the utility, during the test period or periods under review, to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services or, for any test period commencing after December 31, 2012, for DEV and after December 31, 2013, for AEP, more than 70 basis points below a fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services; (iv) allows certain large general service customers to avoid participation in energy efficiency programs and to avoid paying for the costs of such programs through a rate adjustment clause upon receiving an exemption from the Commission; and (v) provides that certain energy efficiency pilot programs may be deemed to be in the public interest.",6,,Failed to pass in House,2020-03-12,https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB1450/2020,,elderly

Provides that when a covered person receives covered emergency services from an out-of-network health care provider, the covered person is not required to pay the out-of-network provider any amount other than the applicable cost-sharing requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such services. The measure also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the health carrier's required payment to the out-of-network provider of the emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is obligated to pay to the out-of-network provider if the amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the health carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency service. The measure requires the health carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, directly to the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. If such provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier does not comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the provider and the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution is not reached, authorizes either party to request the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives emergency services for a medical condition shall not be considered in the health carrier's determination of whether the medical condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the procedure by which the regional average for commercial payments for emergency services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that compiles the Virginia All-Payer Claims Database.

Provides that when a covered person receives covered emergency services from an out-of-network health care provider, the covered person is not required to pay the out-of-network provider any amount other than the applicable cost-sharing requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such services. The measure also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the health carrier's required payment to the out-of-network provider of the emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is obligated to pay to the out-of-network provider if the amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the health carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency service. The measure requires the health carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, directly to the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. If such provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier does not comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the provider and the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution is not reached, authorizes either party to request the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives emergency services for a medical condition shall not be considered in the health carrier's determination of whether the medical condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the procedure by which the regional average for commercial payments for emergency services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that compiles the Virginia All-Payer Claims Database.

The measure (i) eliminates the 50 basis point performance incentive that has been available to utilities that attain the renewable energy portfolio standard goals; (ii) replaces the provision that has authorized the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to adopt a performance incentive that may increase or decrease a utility's combined rate of return by up to 100 basis points, based on a comparison of the utility's generating plant performance, customer service, and operating efficiency with nationally recognized standards, with a provision that authorizes the SCC to increase or decrease the utility's combined rate of return consistent with its precedent for incumbent electric utilities prior to the 2007 re-regulation legislation; (iii) increases the threshold for determining whether the utility's earned combined rate of return on common equity is excessive or insufficient, for test periods commencing after December 31, 2012, from 50 basis points above or below the return determined by the SCC to 70 basis points above or below such return; (iv) eliminates the provision that requires the SCC, when it determines that rates should be revised or credits applied to customers' bills, to combine a rate adjustment clause previously implemented to recover transmission-related costs with the utility's costs, revenues, and investments until the amounts that are the subject of the rate adjustment clause are fully recovered; (v) eliminates the provision that authorizes the SCC to include in a rate adjustment clause for environmental costs the enhanced rate of return on common equity that is provided for new generation facilities if the environmental costs reduce the need for constructing new generation facilities by enabling the continued operation of existing generation facilities; (vi) requires a utility seeking approval to construct a generating facility to demonstrate that it has considered and weighed alternative options, including third-party market alternatives, in its selection process; (vii) eliminates the authorization for a utility to earn an enhanced rate of return on the costs of a new generation facility during the first portion of its service life if the facility does not utilize nuclear power or offshore wind, unless the SCC has approved a rate adjustment clause for the facility by July 1, 2013, or the utility filed a petition therefor on or before January 1, 2013; (viii) reduces the potential enhanced rate of return on the costs of a new generation facility utilizing nuclear power or offshore wind from 200 to 100 basis points; (ix) requires certain costs related to early retirement of generation plants, severe weather events, and natural disasters to be deemed to have been recovered through customer rates during the test period under review unless doing so would place the utility in an under-earning position, in which event the SCC is required to authorize deferred recovery of such costs and allow the utility to amortize and recover the deferred costs over future periods; and (x) directs that the fair combined rate of return on common equity determined by the SCC in a biennial rate review shall apply to the entire two successive 12-month test periods ending December 31 immediately preceding the year of the utility's subsequent biennial review filing for purposes of reviewing the utility's earnings on its rates for generation and distribution services. The measure also requires Appalachian Power, referred to as a Phase I utility, to delay the filing of its next biennial review from March 31, 2013, until March 31, 2014. Such a utility is prohibited from deferring on its books for future recovery certain costs incurred during calendar year 2011 and is required to file subsequent biennial filings by March 31, 2016, and every two years thereafter.

An existing provision authorizing the General Assembly to define what constitutes a public use is removed. The proposed amendment provides that private property can be taken or damaged only for a public use, only with just compensation to the owner, and only so much taken as is necessary for the public use. Just compensation must equal or exceed the value of the property taken, lost profits and lost access, and damages to the residue caused by the taking. A public service company, public service corporation, or railroad exercises the power of eminent domain for public use when such exercise is for the authorized provision of utility, common carrier, or railroad services. In all other cases, a taking or damaging of private property is not for public use if the primary use is for private gain, private benefit, private enterprise, increasing jobs, increasing tax revenue, or economic development, except for the elimination of a public nuisance existing on the property. The condemnor bears the burden of proving that the use is public, without a presumption that it is.",4,,Governor: Acts of Assembly Chapter text (CHAP0736),2012-04-10,https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HJR3/2012,,aging

The measure prohibits a health benefit plan from (i) prohibiting or limiting any resident who is eligible for reimbursement for pharmacy services under a health benefit plan from selecting the pharmacy of his choice to furnish such benefits when the pharmacy has agreed to participate in the health benefit plan according to the terms offered by the insurer; (ii) denying a pharmacy the opportunity to participate as a contract provider under a health benefit plan if the pharmacy agrees to provide pharmacy services that meet the terms and requirements of the insurer; (iii) imposing a copayment, fee, or condition that is not equally imposed upon all individuals in the same benefit category, class, or copayment level or a monetary advantage or penalty under a health benefit plan that would affect or influence a beneficiary's choice of pharmacy; (iv) reducing allowable reimbursement for pharmacy services to a beneficiary because the beneficiary selects a pharmacy of his choice; or (v) requiring a beneficiary to purchase pharmacy services exclusively through a mail-order pharmacy. A pharmacist who waives, discounts, rebates, or distorts a copayment or a beneficiary's coinsurance portion of a prescription drug coverage or reimbursement, or who fails to provide its pharmacy services to all enrollees on the same terms, is subject to license revocation or suspension by the Board of Pharmacy. Discriminatory offering of rebates and marketing incentives are prohibited. A provision stating that the State Corporation Commission has no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies arising out of the section is deleted. Insurers violating this measure are subject to civil penalties, license revocation or suspension, and injunctive relief. A violation creates a civil cause of action for damages or injunctive relief in favor of any person or pharmacy aggrieved by the violation. The Commissioner of Insurance is prohibited from approving any health benefit plan providing pharmaceutical services that does not conform to this section. A provision of a health benefit plan that is contrary to this measure is void.",1,,Senate: Left in Commerce and Labor,2011-02-08,https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/SB879/2011,,pension
